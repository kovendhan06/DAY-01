                                     Programming Paradigm

                     A programming paradigm is a style or "way" of programming..
         some languaes make it easy to write in some paradigms but not others..

       Some common Paradigms:

             you should know these:
        
        Improative:
                   Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.
     

        Declarative:
                  
                   Programming by specifying the result you want no how to get it.


        Structured:
                  
                  Progamming with clean goto free nested control structes.
      

        Procedural:
                  imperactive programming with procedure calls.


        Function:
                 (Applicative):Programming with function calls that avoid any global state..


        function-level:
              
                 (Combinator):programming with no variables at all.


       Object-oriented:
               
                 Programmming by define objects that send messages to each other


      class -based:
              
                 objects get state and behavier based on membership in a class.


      Protype-based:
           
                 objects get behaviouer based prototype object.


      Event - driven:

                 Programming with emitters and listencers of asynchronous actions.

      Flow-Driven:

                 Programming process communicating with each other over predifined channels.

      Logic:
                 (Rule-based):Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules.an engine infers the answer to question.
   

      Array:  
                Programming with powerful array operators that usually make loops unnecessary.
